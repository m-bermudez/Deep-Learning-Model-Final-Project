On multiple occasions, she insisted that she be \nallowed\nto self-administer insulin or specify the exact dose she should\nreceive. I also reiterated that we were willing to\nnegotiate and adjust her insulin dosing with her. - Diabetes: Unfortunately, we had some difficulties keeping your \nsugars under control in the hospital. Your measure of long-term \ncontrol, the A1c, is very high (around 9%, where the goal is < \n7% and normal is less than 5.4%). This suggests that you need \nmore insulin at regular times of day (before breakfast, lunch, \ndinner, and at bedtime). We're concerned \nbecause uncontrolled diabetes can cause heart disease, kidney \nproblems, and strokes, and with some modifications to your \nregimen, we think your diabetes can be better controlled and \nyour risk of these conditions developing will be lower."}

Labs:  WBC 17 -> 20.5, Bicarb 11 -> 8, Glucose 519 -> 425 -> \n372,\nAnion gap 29 - > 25, K 4.7. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of T1D on \nHumalog insulin pump (followed by Dr. #Diabetic Ketoacidosis\nMr. ___ presented in DKA with anion gap of 25, serum glucose \nof 425, elevated beta hydroxybuterate and a metabolic acidosis. He was initiated on an insulin infusion, normal saline boluses, \nand potassium and phosphate repletion. His insulin infusion was eventually weaned \ndown per protocol and when it reached 4u\/hour we initiated \ninsulin subcutaneously with a initial basal dose of 28u \nglargine, standing humalog of 3u per meal and a sliding scale. The etiology of his DKA was not immediately clear. There was concern that his insulin \npump may have malfunctioned, though there was no clear evidence \nthis was the case.
